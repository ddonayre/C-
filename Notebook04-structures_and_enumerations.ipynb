        "So far we have seen simple data types representing single value-ed data. For example, `int` is a data type representing individual integer values such as 6, 89, and 100. The same can be said about the simple types:\n",
        "* `char` representing individual characters such as `'@'` and `'Z'`;\n",
        "* `short` and `long` representing special types of integers with individual values such as `12S`, and `876L`;\n",
        "* `float` or `double` representing individual floating-point numbers (numbers with fractions) such as `5.4F` and `523.17`.\n",
        "* `bool` representing the individual boolean values of `true` or `false`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the data we deal with is, however, composite; it contains complex values that are made out of multiple simpler values of either the same type or of different types. C++ gives us two main ways to create new composite data types out of other simpler types: **structures** and **classes**. These types represent **structured values** which are composite (complex) values made from simpler values. This notebook covers structures; classes will be covered later on.\n",
